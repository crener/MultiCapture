# MultiCapture

This project aimes to produce software that is able to co-ordinate and capture images at the same time and then transmit all data to a single hub pi which stoargs and manages all images taken. The goal of this is to collect image sets and trasmit them to a powerful desktop/server for sterioscopic computer vision analysis.

There is a [companion program to this](https://github.com/crener/MultiCapture-InspectionTool) which connects to the Pi acting as a hub to trigger commands such as taking images.
